"""
Getting and setting model data might be expensive and highly dependent on the
actual model.

The model proxy classes provide a uniform interface that can be used by the
`QAbstractItemModel` to get and set model data while defering the cost of
these operations.

Each different type of model that needs to be displayed in Camelot should implement
it's own concrete `ModelProxy`.  Camelot has a built in `ModelProxy` for pure
python lists and for sqlalchemy query objects.

The model proxy classes should be used in the model thread, but they
can be constructed in the gui thread.

This module defines the `AbstractModelProxy` interface class.
Concrete model proxy classes should implement this interface to be usable
by the `QAbstractItemModel`.

The proxy guarantees temporary consistency, meaning that as long as no sort, add,
remove or filter operation is applied on the proxy, an object returned at an index
by the proxy will stay at this index, even when the model has changed.

        been modified without the proxy being aware of it.  So the proxy might fail

        requested.
